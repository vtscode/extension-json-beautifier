## Code Explanation

### Files:

- **`manifest.json`**  
   This is the configuration file for the Chrome extension. It contains metadata such as the extension name, version, permissions, and background scripts.

- **`popup.html`**  
   This is the HTML structure for the popup. It includes two textareas for input and output, buttons for beautifying, minifying, and copying the result, and a small section for error messages.

- **`popup.js`**  
   This JavaScript file handles the logic of the extension. It listens for button clicks, processes the JSON input (either beautifying or minifying), handles errors, and copies the result to the clipboard.

- **`background.js`**  
   Background worker for the extension (not used in this example, but can be extended for future functionalities like handling different tabs, etc.).

- **`styles.css`**  
   The styles for the extension popup. Customize it as needed.
